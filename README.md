Classification problems can be broadly split into two categories: Binary Classification means there are only two possible label classes. Example: A patient's condition is cancerous or it isn't; or a financial transaction is fraudulent or not. Multi-class classification refers to the cases where there are more than two label classes. Spam Detection is a similar case of Binary Classification.

This website is specifically built to detect and predict whether a message is SPAM or HAM(Legitimate)
We have used a dataset containing a large number of SMS which include spam and those which aren't. 

Using Multinomial Naive Bayes Machine Learning Algorithm which can predict whether a message is spam or not. The backend of the project has been written in Jupyter Notebook and PyCharm Community Edition using Python Language.
Packages such as 'sklearn' , 'pickle' and 'win32 client' have been used to make the execution possible.

The website is currently being displayed on Streamlit using the imported 'streamlit' package which displays the content in the web browser.
